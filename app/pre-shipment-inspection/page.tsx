        PSI – Pre-Shipment Inspection
A Pre-Shipment Inspection (PSI) is a crucial quality control measure that provides importers with confidence that their products meet specified standards before being dispatched.
At Academia, we offer professional PSI services to help businesses safeguard against the risks and costs associated with receiving defective or non-compliant goods. This inspection process ensures that serious quality issues are identified before shipment, preventing financial loss, operational disruption, and damage to brand reputation.
Pre-shipment inspections are one of the most effective tools to confirm the overall quality and conformity of a shipment. They ensure that products meet international, local, and client-specific requirements and regulations. For an effective PSI, the goods should be between 80% and 100% ready. Samples are randomly selected following internationally recognized standards such as AQL, ISO 2859-1, or ANSI/ASQC Z1.4 & Z1.9.
Typical control points covered in a PSI include:
<ul>
<li>	Material quality inspection</li>
<li>	Functional testing (electrical, mechanical, aging, and heat </li>resistance)
<li>	Color consistency and paint quality</li>
<li>	Visual and aesthetic assessment</li>
<li>	Marking and labeling accuracy</li>
<li>	Dimensional verification</li>
<li>	Packaging evaluation</li>
<li>	Compliance with standards and regulatory requirements (e.g., CE, CB)</li>
<li>	Custom client requirements</li>

</ul>
Upon completion of the inspection, a detailed report is provided within 24 hours, enabling the importer to decide whether to accept or reject the shipment.
Since 2007, Academia has conducted professional PSI services across various industries, including white goods, automotive manufacturing, construction materials, insulation, and medical equipment, with the support of our experienced quality control experts.


FPC – Factory Production Control
Factory Production Control (FPC) refers to the internal control procedures a manufacturer establishes to ensure consistent product quality and traceability. It plays a critical role in identifying and correcting non-conforming materials, processes, or products and fostering continuous improvement.
FPC systems must be tailored to each manufacturer's specific production processes. A typical FPC includes the following procedures:
⦁	Regular calibration and inspection of testing, measuring, and weighing equipment
⦁	Maintenance and inspection of manufacturing equipment
⦁	Documentation and inspection of incoming materials and components
⦁	Defined manufacturing procedures with responsible personnel and recorded checks
⦁	In-process and final product inspections
⦁	Procedures for managing non-conforming products
Key elements assessed during an FPC audit include:
⦁	Evaluation of the factory’s quality management system and production process, from raw material sourcing to final product dispatch
⦁	Review of supplier records, equipment calibration logs, and customer complaint records
⦁	Verification of product traceability and production formulas
⦁	On-site inspection of manufacturing facilities and equipment
⦁	Observation of production processes and sample selection (if necessary)
⦁	Review of documentation such as quality manuals, procedures, and records
⦁	Interviews with factory management and operational staff
These elements are analyzed to determine the manufacturer’s ability to consistently produce products that comply with relevant standards.
Annual surveillance audits are conducted to ensure ongoing compliance. After each audit, a comprehensive report outlines findings and recommendations. If the factory meets the scheme’s requirements, the certification process proceeds. In cases of non-compliance, corrective actions must be implemented.
Manufacturers view the FPC audit as a valuable health check, supporting their continuous improvement efforts and long-term success.
